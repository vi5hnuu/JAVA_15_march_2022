Interfaces in Java
In the Java programming language, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class,
that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and
nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods,private methods and static methods(Static binding). Interfaces
cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or
 extended by other interfaces. Extension is discussed later in this lesson.
